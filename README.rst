Python 3 Package Cookiecutter
=============================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg

An opinionated, dead-simple cookiecutter_ for modern Python 3 packages.

*Adapted from Audrey's* cookiecutter-pypackage_


Features
--------

* Testing setup with ``py.test``
* Future-proof use of Pipfile_ as opposed to requirements.txt [see pipenv_]
* Tox_ testing: Setup to easily test
* Sphinx_ docs: Documentation ready for generation and hosting on `GitHub Pages`_
* Bumpversion_: Pre-configured version bumping with a single command
* Command line interface with Click_

Quickstart
----------

Install the latest `Cookiecutter`_ and `pipenv`_ (optional, but highly recommended) if you haven't installed it yet.

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install cookiecutter pipenv


Generate a Python package project

.. code-block:: bash

    cookiecutter https://github.com/mat02/python-package-template.git --checkout cloudfoundry

    # answer questions to generate project template

    cd your_new_project

    # generate the virtual environment and activate it

    pipenv shell # or whatever you use to manage your venvs

    # install package dependencies within venv

    pip install -e .[dev]

The last step will install the task runner at the root of the repo, `run.py`_ as a command-line
utility ``{{project_slug}} dev``.

    # to run the development server locally

    {{project_slug}} runserver

    # deploy

    {{project_slug}} dev deploy

Development
-----------

You should now have a command-line tool ``{{project_slug}} dev`` which you can use to execute common tasks.

This is just a shortcut to the `run.py`_ file at the root of your project,
meaning you have 3 ways of executing the task runner::

    {{project_slug}} dev

    # or, from project root

    ./run.py

    # or

    python -m run

The following are some of the sub-commands you may find::

Additional Options
------------------

* Create a GitHub repo for your generated project.
* Add the repo to your Travis-CI_ account.
* Activate your project on `pyup.io`_. (if using pipenv, you can generate requirements.txt with ``pipenv lock -r``)
